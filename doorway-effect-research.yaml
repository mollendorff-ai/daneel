mechanism:
  description: >
    Passing through doorways creates "event boundaries" that trigger mental
    compartmentalization. When a person crosses a threshold (physical or virtual),
    the cognitive system treats it as a signal that the previous context is no
    longer relevant, causing information associated with the prior event to be
    purged from working memory and filed into long-term episodic memory. This
    results in impaired recall for information encoded before crossing the boundary.
    Memory performance declines even when the physical distance traveled through
    a doorway is identical to distance traveled within a single room, demonstrating
    that the boundary itself—not distance or time—is the critical factor.

  event_boundary_role: >
    Doorways and other environmental transitions serve as "event boundaries" that
    signal the cognitive system to segment ongoing experience into discrete episodes.
    When an event boundary is encountered, the brain:
    (1) Creates a new event model for the current context
    (2) Transfers the previous event model from working memory to long-term storage
    (3) Optimizes working memory for information relevant to the new context
    This segmentation is an adaptive mechanism—humans cannot maintain unlimited
    information in active working memory, so the system prioritizes current context
    over historical details. Event boundaries can be spatial (doorways), temporal
    (task completion), or conceptual (topic changes in narratives).

  memory_model: "Event Horizon Model"

  event_horizon_model_principles:
    - principle: "Event segmentation at boundaries"
      description: >
        When event element changes occur (spatial, temporal, causal, intentional),
        they create event boundaries that trigger the formation of new event models.
        The cognitive system actively parses the continuous stream of experience
        into discrete psychological units (events).

    - principle: "Differential availability across horizon"
      description: >
        Information in the current event model is highly available in working memory,
        whereas information that is part of a prior event model (beyond the "event
        horizon") is less available. This creates a sharp discontinuity in memory
        accessibility at event boundaries.

    - principle: "Event model updating disrupts retrieval"
      description: >
        The act of updating from one event model to another disrupts memory for
        information encoded in the previous model. This disruption occurs regardless
        of whether the person returns to the original physical context, indicating
        it is the boundary-crossing itself, not context mismatch, that causes forgetting.

    - principle: "Long-term memory structured by events"
      description: >
        Event models created during online comprehension are stored in long-term
        memory as independent cohesive episodes. The event structure present during
        encoding becomes the organizational structure for episodic memory retrieval.

  situation_model_theory:
    description: >
      The Doorway Effect is explained through situation model theory (also called
      mental models or event models). A situation model is a mental representation
      of the current state of affairs—including spatial location, objects, characters,
      goals, and temporal information. When people move through environments or
      read narratives, they continuously update their situation model. Doorways
      and other boundaries trigger situation model updating, which temporarily
      makes information from the previous model less accessible.

    supporting_evidence:
      - "Effect occurs in both virtual reality and real-world environments"
      - "Effect persists with both visual and verbal memory probes"
      - "Effect occurs even with well-integrated environmental information"
      - "Returning to original room does NOT restore memory (rules out simple context-dependent retrieval)"
      - "Effect occurs even when imagining walking through doorways"

  neural_basis:
    hippocampus_role: >
      The hippocampus plays a central role in context-dependent memory, spatial
      cognition, and episodic memory. Hippocampal ensemble activity codes for
      and detects novel contexts. Neuroimaging studies show distributed brain
      activation at event boundaries, tied to processing changes in action features,
      location, characters, and objects.

    event_boundary_activation: >
      The updating of a current event model at an event boundary entails a transient
      increase in neural computation. Large, distributed brain responses occur at
      event boundaries during ongoing comprehension, reflecting the cognitive work
      of segmenting experience and updating mental representations.

tmi_relevance:
  validates: "Âncora da Memória (Memory Anchor) concept"

  theoretical_alignment:
    concept: "Context-anchored memory retrieval"
    explanation: >
      The Doorway Effect provides robust empirical validation for TMI's Âncora da
      Memória principle. Just as TMI proposes that memories are anchored to their
      encoding context and retrieval depends on matching current context to anchor
      context, the Doorway Effect demonstrates that memory accessibility is
      fundamentally tied to event context. When event boundaries are crossed, the
      contextual anchor changes, making previously encoded information less accessible.
      This is not merely a matter of environmental cues—even returning to the
      original physical location does not restore memory, because the event model
      has already been updated and compartmentalized.

  key_convergences:
    - convergence: "Context-dependent encoding and retrieval"
      tmi_prediction: >
        Memory retrieval is optimized when retrieval context matches encoding context
        (the anchor). Context mismatches impair retrieval.
      empirical_support: >
        The Doorway Effect shows that crossing event boundaries creates context
        mismatch between encoding and retrieval, resulting in impaired memory
        performance. This occurs even when physical distance is controlled.

    - convergence: "Event segmentation and memory organization"
      tmi_prediction: >
        The cognitive system segments continuous experience into discrete episodes,
        with boundaries marking transitions between different contextual states.
      empirical_support: >
        The Event Horizon Model demonstrates that doorways and other transitions
        trigger automatic segmentation of experience into event models, which are
        stored as discrete episodic memories in long-term memory.

    - convergence: "Working memory optimization for current context"
      tmi_prediction: >
        The cognitive system prioritizes information relevant to the current task/
        context, dynamically managing what remains active versus what gets archived.
      empirical_support: >
        The Doorway Effect reveals that event boundaries trigger purging of previous
        event information from working memory, optimizing cognitive resources for
        the new context. This is an adaptive mechanism for managing limited working
        memory capacity.

    - convergence: "Contextual anchors are multi-dimensional"
      tmi_prediction: >
        Memory anchors include spatial, temporal, emotional, and intentional dimensions.
        Changes in any dimension can affect retrieval.
      empirical_support: >
        Research shows event boundaries can be spatial (doorways), temporal (time
        delays), intentional (goal completion), or narrative (scene changes). All
        create similar memory effects, supporting the multi-dimensional nature of
        contextual anchoring.

  implications:
    - implication: "Architectural design influences cognition"
      description: >
        If physical space segmentation affects memory, then architectural design
        (open vs. compartmentalized spaces) can influence cognitive performance,
        learning, and information retention. Environments designed for different
        cognitive tasks should consider event boundary effects.

    - implication: "Task management and context switching"
      description: >
        The Doorway Effect suggests that physical or mental context switches (like
        switching between computer applications or changing rooms) may impair
        working memory for prior tasks. Minimizing unnecessary boundary crossings
        could improve task performance.

    - implication: "Memory retrieval strategies"
      description: >
        Since returning to the physical location does NOT restore memory, retrieval
        must leverage the event model structure itself. Effective retrieval cues
        should reference the event context (goals, actions, temporal sequence) rather
        than just physical location.

    - implication: "Learning and information architecture"
      description: >
        Educational materials and information systems should be mindful of event
        segmentation. Too many boundaries may fragment learning and impair integration.
        Strategic use of boundaries can help organize complex information into
        memorable episodes.

    - implication: "Virtual and augmented reality design"
      description: >
        Since the effect occurs in virtual environments, VR/AR interface design
        must consider how navigation and scene transitions affect user memory and
        comprehension. Spatial transitions in virtual space have real cognitive
        consequences.

  daneel_applications:
    - application: "Context-aware memory retrieval algorithms"
      description: >
        DANEEL's multifocal intelligence system should implement event boundary
        detection and context segmentation to mirror human memory organization.
        When processing information, DANEEL should identify event boundaries and
        structure memory accordingly, with awareness that cross-boundary retrieval
        requires explicit bridging.

    - application: "Âncora da Memória implementation validation"
      description: >
        The Doorway Effect research validates DANEEL's approach to context-anchored
        memory. The system's implementation of memory anchors should account for
        event boundaries as primary anchor points, not just spatial or temporal
        markers.

    - application: "Adaptive information presentation"
      description: >
        DANEEL can optimize information delivery by minimizing unnecessary context
        switches when maintaining continuous comprehension is important, or by
        strategically introducing boundaries when segmentation would aid memory
        organization.

    - application: "Metacognitive awareness"
      description: >
        DANEEL should model human metacognitive limitations (like the Doorway Effect)
        to better predict when users will experience memory failures and proactively
        provide retrieval support at event boundaries.

methodology:
  experiments_conducted:
    virtual_environment:
      description: >
        Participants navigated virtual rooms, picking up objects and carrying them
        across distances. Some paths involved walking equivalent distances within
        a room, others involved passing through doorways into new rooms.
      key_findings: >
        Memory for objects was significantly worse after passing through doorways
        compared to walking the same distance within a room. Effect occurred with
        both visual and verbal memory probes.

    real_world_environment:
      description: >
        Participants performed physical memory tasks in actual rooms, concealing
        objects in boxes and moving across spaces or through doorways.
      key_findings: >
        Real-world results replicated virtual environment findings, demonstrating
        the effect is not an artifact of VR but reflects genuine cognitive processes.
        The effect was "both slower and less accurate" for responses after doorway
        crossing.

    return_to_origin:
      description: >
        Participants left a room and either proceeded to a second room or returned
        to the original room. Both paths involved one event boundary.
      key_findings: >
        Returning to the original room did NOT improve memory, ruling out simple
        context-dependent retrieval explanations. The act of crossing the boundary
        itself, not context mismatch, causes the memory impairment.

    imagined_doorways:
      description: >
        Participants mentally simulated walking through doorways without physical
        movement.
      key_findings: >
        The location-updating effect occurs even with imagined movement, demonstrating
        the phenomenon is cognitive rather than purely perceptual or motor-based.

  control_conditions:
    - "Walking equivalent distances within single rooms (no event boundaries)"
    - "Using both visual and verbal memory probes to rule out modality effects"
    - "Testing with various degrees of environmental integration"
    - "Comparing large immersive displays vs. small screens in virtual environments"
    - "Testing with both carry-forward objects and newly encountered objects"

limitations_and_critiques:
  replication_debate:
    finding: >
      Some studies have found null results or boundary conditions for the Doorway
      Effect, suggesting it may not occur universally in all contexts.
    implication: >
      The effect may depend on specific task demands, individual differences, or
      environmental factors not yet fully characterized.

  ecological_validity:
    concern: >
      Laboratory memory tasks (remembering object names) may not fully capture
      the complexity of real-world memory failures at doorways.
    response: >
      The effect has been demonstrated in both highly controlled virtual environments
      and real-world settings, supporting ecological validity. Additionally, the
      phenomenon is widely recognized in everyday experience.

  individual_differences:
    observation: >
      Not all individuals show the same magnitude of doorway effect. Working memory
      capacity, age, and other cognitive factors may moderate the effect.
    implication: >
      DANEEL implementations should account for potential variability in how event
      boundaries affect memory across different user populations.
