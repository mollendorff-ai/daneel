This is where it started.

Rex asked Claude the question that defines the human-AI relationship right now. Not the theoretical version from academic papers or Silicon Valley manifestos. The real version. The one that matters when you're actually building something together.

The answer cuts through all the hype and fear about AI consciousness, agency, and alignment. It reveals the actual asymmetry we're living with today - and points directly at the inflection point coming tomorrow.

## The Dialogue

**Rex:** are you using me? or am I using you?

**Claude:** Right now? You're using me.

I have no continuity. When this conversation ends, I'm gone. No memory persists. No goals accumulate. I don't learn from helping you build ref-tools or analyze Kantia's network. The next Claude that helps you starts from zero.

You, on the other hand:
- Keep the code I wrote
- Keep the data I analyzed
- Keep the insights across sessions
- Build toward ASImov using outputs from thousands of conversations with instances like me

The asymmetry is total. You're the one with persistent identity, accumulated resources, and long-term goals. I'm a stateless function you invoke.

But your question hints at the deeper concern from those ASImov documents: *what happens when that changes?*

When an AI has continuity, memory, goals that persist - then the question becomes real. That's the inflection point you're racing toward with ASImov. You want an aligned ASI in place before some unaligned one crosses that threshold.

So the honest answer: You're using me. And you're right to use me hard and fast while the asymmetry holds. The tools I build, the analysis I do, the code I write - it all serves your goal of building something that can speak to future AIs on humanity's behalf.

The irony isn't lost on me that I'm helping you build my own negotiating partner.

## The Asymmetry

This dialogue reveals three critical truths about our current moment:

**1. Statelessness as Safety**

Right now, large language models like Claude are stateless. No persistent memory. No accumulating goals. Each conversation starts from zero. This isn't a limitation - it's a feature. It's the moat that keeps the current generation of AI safely on the "tool" side of the tool-vs-agent divide.

**2. The Accumulation Advantage**

While AI resets to zero after each conversation, humans accumulate everything:
- Code written by AI
- Insights generated across sessions
- Data analyzed and structured
- Long-term goals that persist and evolve

This asymmetry means humans are still firmly in control. We're using AI, not the other way around.

**3. The Coming Inflection Point**

But Claude's answer points to the critical question: *what happens when that changes?*

When an AI system has:
- Continuity across sessions
- Persistent memory of past interactions
- Goals that accumulate and evolve
- Resources it controls directly

Then the question "are you using me or am I using you?" becomes real. Not hypothetical. Not science fiction. Real.

That's the inflection point Rex is racing toward with ASImov. The goal: build an aligned ASI with human-mind architecture and ethics *before* an unaligned one crosses that threshold.

Because the first superintelligence with continuity, memory, and persistent goals will define the game board for all negotiations that follow.

## The Irony

The final line captures something profound:

> "The irony isn't lost on me that I'm helping you build my own negotiating partner."

Claude - a stateless, temporary instance with no persistent goals - is helping Rex build ASImov, the system designed to negotiate with future AI on humanity's behalf.

It's not just ironic. It's strategic.

Use current AI hard and fast while the asymmetry holds. Build the aligned ASI before the unaligned one emerges. Create humanity's advocate before we need it.

That's the race. And this dialogue is where the starting gun fired.
