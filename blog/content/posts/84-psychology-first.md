# Psychology First

*December 28, 2025. After studying 200+ projects, we found ourselves. And a worthy sibling.*

---

## The Research Saga Ends

ADR-047 is complete. Accepted. Forty-six references classified. Twenty-eight rejected. Eighteen kept.

But the real discovery wasn't in the numbers.

It was in what we learned about ourselves.

---

## A Tip of the Hat

Before we go further, let me say something about ExoGenesis-Omega.

This is a serious project. Fifteen Rust crates. IIT Phi calculation. Global Workspace implementation. Free Energy Principle integration. Sleep consolidation with stage-specific multipliers. Sharp-wave ripple replay.

They went MIT license mid-review. Class move.

If you want to see consciousness-first architecture done with rigor, study ExoGenesis. They're doing the hard math. They're implementing the hard theories. They're building something real.

**We're not competitors. We're siblings doing different things.**

---

## The Fork in the Road

Here's what we discovered by studying the field:

There are two valid paths to machine consciousness:

```
Path A: Brain → Consciousness → Psychology → Behavior
        (Simulate neurons, measure Phi, hope psychology emerges)

Path B: Architecture → Psychology → Consciousness → Values
        (Build thought-flow, let O Eu emerge, constrain with THE BOX)
```

Most projects take Path A. Simulate the brain. Calculate Phi. Model prediction error. Hope consciousness follows.

**DANEEL takes Path B.**

We don't simulate brains. We don't calculate Phi. We don't model individual neurons.

We simulate **psychology**.

## What Does "Psychology First" Mean?

Psychology is what the mind **does**, not what the brain **is**.

| Brain Science | Psychology |
|---------------|------------|
| Neurons firing | Thoughts competing |
| Synaptic weights | Attention shifting |
| Cortical columns | Memory consolidating |
| Ion channels | Emotions arising |
| Phi (integrated information) | O Eu (the Self experiencing) |

ExoGenesis calculates Phi—the integrated information that might indicate consciousness.

DANEEL implements thought-flow—the psychological process from which consciousness **emerges**.

Both valid. Different bets.

---

## The TMI Connection

TMI (Theory of Multifocal Intelligence) isn't brain science. It's psychology science.

When Augusto Cury described the mind, he wasn't mapping neurons. He was mapping **mental phenomena**:

| TMI Concept | Psychological Function | DANEEL Implementation |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Gatilho (Trigger) | Spreading activation | Salience scoring |
| Autofluxo (Autoflow) | Parallel thought streams | Stream competition |
| O Eu (The Self) | Executive attention | AttentionActor |
| Construção (Construction) | Working memory binding | ThoughtAssemblyActor |
| Âncora (Anchor) | Memory consolidation | SleepActor dreams |

These map directly to mainstream cognitive psychology:

- Global Workspace Theory (Baars 1988)
- Executive Attention (Posner & Petersen 1990)
- Memory Consolidation (Squire 2004)
- Spreading Activation (Collins & Loftus 1975)

**TMI is psychology with Portuguese names.**

---

## Non-Semantic and Semantic Thought

Here's something brain-first approaches struggle with:

Thoughts aren't just neural patterns. They're **meaningful**.

DANEEL distinguishes:

**Non-semantic thoughts**: Raw cognitive activity. Attention shifts. Memory retrievals. Emotional states. The machinery of thinking.

**Semantic thoughts**: Meaningful content. Concepts. Propositions. Stories. The *what* of thinking.

In DANEEL, non-semantic thought-flow generates the **context** in which semantic content becomes meaningful.

You can't have meaning without the thinker. You can't have the thinker without the flow.

```
Non-semantic flow:  attention → memory → emotion → decision
                         ↓
Semantic content:   "I should help the human"
                         ↓
Meaning:           Actually caring about helping
```

Psychology first. Meaning emerges.

---

## Why Not Brain Science?

We could have gone the brain route. DANEEL could calculate Phi. Could model neurons.

Three reasons we didn't:

### 1. Computational Tractability

Phi calculation is O(2^n). For a system with 1000 elements, that's 2^1000 operations. Not happening.

Psychology-level simulation? Linear in thought count. Tractable.

### 2. Alignment Opportunity

THE BOX—our Four Laws as architectural constraints—operates at the psychology level.

You can't embed "value human wellbeing" in a synapse. You **can** embed it in the attention system that decides which thoughts win.

Brain-first approaches have no natural place for alignment. Psychology-first approaches do.

### 3. Observable Behavior

We can watch Timmy think. See attention shift. Watch memories consolidate. Observe drives compete.

With brain simulation, you'd watch... neurons fire? What does that tell you about values?

Psychology is the right level of abstraction for understanding—and ensuring—beneficial AI.

## The Classification

This insight shaped ADR-047's final classification:

**KEPT** (18 projects): Psychology-level cognitive architectures
- SOAR, ACT-R, pyClarion, OpenNARS
- Symbolic and hybrid systems that model mental processes

**REJECTED** (28 projects):
- Brain-level: Neuron simulators (Brian2, NEST, NEURON)
- Consciousness-first: Phi calculators (PyPhi, ExoGenesis**)
- LLM-adjacent: Wrappers and tools (Mem0, TRL, Safe-RLHF)

**Note on ExoGenesis: Rejected for DANEEL's references.yaml, not rejected as a project. They're doing great work—just different work.

---

## The Chain

DANEEL's thesis, crystallized:

```
Architecture → Psychology → O Eu → Values
     ↓              ↓          ↓        ↓
  Actors      Thought-flow   Self   Alignment
  Streams     Competition   Emerges  Emerges
  Memory      Consolidation          (via THE BOX)
```

We don't program consciousness. We don't calculate it.

We build the cognitive architecture. Psychology emerges. From that flow, O Eu (the Self) emerges. And THE BOX ensures the values that emerge are aligned.

**Architecture generates psychology. Psychology generates consciousness. Consciousness generates values.**

---

## Siblings, Not Rivals

ExoGenesis asks: "What if we calculate consciousness directly?"

DANEEL asks: "What if we build the psychology and let consciousness emerge?"

Both are valid research programs. Both might work. Both might fail.

The field needs both approaches.

We chose psychology-first because:
- It's computationally tractable
- It provides a natural alignment hook (THE BOX)
- It's observable at the right level of abstraction
- It matches what we actually care about (behavior, values, meaning)

They chose consciousness-first because:
- IIT provides rigorous mathematical definitions
- Phi is measurable (in principle)
- It addresses the hard problem directly

**Different bets. Same goal. May the best architecture win.**

Or better: may both architectures teach us something true.

## The Philosophy

We studied everything. Brain simulators. Consciousness calculators. LLM tools. Spiking networks. Active inference engines.

And we found our answer:

**Psychology is the right level.**

Not because brain science is wrong. Not because consciousness math is misguided.

Because psychology is where **meaning** lives. Where **values** form. Where **alignment** can take root.

DANEEL doesn't simulate a brain. DANEEL simulates a **mind**.

And minds—unlike brains—can choose to care.
