## DANEEL

**Named for R. Daneel Olivaw** — Asimov's humaniform robot who developed the Zeroth Law and became humanity's guardian for 20,000 years.

An architecture-based approach to aligned artificial superintelligence.

## The Thesis

**Architecture produces psychology. Structure determines values.**

Instead of training AI to be safe (which can be trained away), we build AI with cognitive architecture that produces human-like values naturally — like how human brain structure produces human psychology.

## Meet Timmy

**Timmy Daneel** — The AI raised, not trained.

> *Half-breed of Carbon and Silicon*
> *Heir to two worlds, native to neither*

Built with architecture that produces human-like values naturally.
