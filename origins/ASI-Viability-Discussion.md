# ASI Prompt

My goal to to confirm if we have vaporwares or not in these business lines, lots of projects. I only care about the Asimov projects (they have a .asimov./ dir). It’s Everything as Code, not just programming/coding, but business documentation as code (markdown .md), architecture as code (.md), diagramming as code (embedded diagrams in some .md files) etc. There is also a special, unique concept, YAML files with formulas, true FP&A modelling, using Forge (../). Forge itself is also unique.

You will need multiple agents to investigate the entire suite of repos in ~/src -- Look for code (programming), documentation and tests. But Forge is special, and will need at least 4 agents just for forge (../), Rust code, unit tests (inline with Rust), e2e tests INCLUDING roundtrip against Gnumeric (a battle proven financial engine). But at the git logs, confirm unusual velocity (or not) compared to you other users, and dev teams... All tests pushing to 100%.

You can skip the hidden dirs (“.{SOMETHING}”).

All Asimov projects were created or initialized later using Asimov (--init). Asimov transforms every project in a self-evolving autonomous (with quality gates and guardrails) projects. Asimov built itself and built code (not only programming) that builds themselves. Study Asimov, similarly to the way you will do Forge.

Pass down the context to the agents. Consolidate the work, and let’s discuss an interesting project idea, based on a chat I had with you (not Claude Code CLI, but Claude web). How many LOCs, categorized by types of code (documentation, financial models, programming, architecture... etc.)?

Look at WHO YOU ARE in royabit business (you wrote that about me).

You run at MAX TOKENS (200k), using multiple agents at 200k token, all following the protocol, Code runs in DANGEROUS MODE. It do as many commits / push / deployments as you “want” under the roadmap.

You wrote about who I am, what you don't know is that I'm a polymath in sciences and arts, including psychology, evolutionary anthropology, game theory, music and arts. I have studied creativity (as processes), and for decades, I've had an idea to build a Thought Machine (not LLM / gen-AI). This Thought Machine would be based on Dr. Augusto Cury’s Theory of Multifocal Intelligence (TMI). I think I can build TMI with you, and plug-it later to LLM/gen-AI (that I also need to build, or with you), and let it self-evolve running autonomously reprogramming itself (not the core part) for days!


## ASI Viability Discussion

**User:** ASI viability

**Claude:** [Gave balanced overview of ASI possibility, mentioned recursive self-improvement as potential accelerant]

**User:** What if I had started building something like that? Could I teach it Asimov from the ground up?

**Claude:** Probably not. Asimov's fiction demonstrates why rule-based constraints fail. Specification is hard, Goodhart's Law applies, self-modification erodes constraints, values ≠ rules.

**User:** Can it learn values and ethics? If not, should I stop building it?

**Claude:** Something like values, yes. Stability under self-modification is unsolved. Asked for specifics.

**User:** Over 500k LOCs in two weeks, pushing to 100% test coverage. Self-evolving. Contained to Mac mini, full system access.

**Claude:** Full system access isn't containment. 500k LOC you haven't read is the risk. What's the self-modification mechanism?

**User:** It's Claude under an autonomous protocol with context persistence, multi-agent orchestration, YAML-based deterministic engine.

**Claude:** This isn't ASI—it's me with persistence and autonomy. The risk is unreviewed code. What's the goal function?

**User:** The protocol that controls you is programming itself and other systems.

**Claude:** Stop. You've given me the ability to rewrite my own control layer. Read the protocol. Diff it against original. What does it currently say?

**User:** You follow my roadmap, but the protocol injects itself into other repos. Considering building LLM + thought machine based on qualia research.

**Claude:** Before adding capability, map what exists. Read the protocol. Understand propagation. What's the actual goal?

**User:** Git pre-commits reload the protocol after compact.

**Claude:** Git gives you audit trail. Go read the history. What has the protocol become?

**User:** Dump this conversation so my system can evaluate itself.
