# DANEEL Social Media Strategy

**Purpose:** Build awareness for DANEEL as personal research while protecting employment.

**Author:** Rex Tavares
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-15

## Employment Protection Guidelines

### The Golden Rules

1. **Personal R&D framing** — Always position as personal research, never professional
2. **Time boundaries** — Explicitly mention "evenings and weekends" or "personal time"
3. **Equipment clarity** — All work done on personal equipment
4. **No employer mention** — Never reference current employer, clients, or work projects
5. **No work hours posting** — Schedule posts for evenings/weekends only
6. **No proprietary overlap** — DANEEL uses no proprietary knowledge from consulting work

### Conflict of Interest Avoidance

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Personal research project" | "My work on AI safety" (ambiguous) |
| "Weekend project exploring..." | "Professional opinion on..." |
| "Independent researcher" | Mention employer name |
| "Built on personal equipment" | Reference work tools/systems |
| "Exploring TMI theory" | "We should do this at [employer]" |
| "Open source contribution" | Pitch consulting services |

### Standard Disclaimer (Use on All Profiles)

```
Views are my own. Personal research conducted in personal time on personal equipment.
Not affiliated with my employer.
```

## Platform Strategy

### X (Twitter)

**Purpose:** Technical audience, AI safety community, researchers

**Tone:** Technical but accessible, humble, curious

**Content Mix:**
- 40% — Technical insights from DANEEL development
- 30% — AI safety commentary (cite sources, no hot takes)
- 20% — TMI theory education
- 10% — Personal journey/motivation (humanizing)

**Posting Schedule:**
- 3-5 tweets/week
- Schedule for 7-9pm local time or weekends
- Thread format for technical content

**Sample Posts:**

```
Week 1: Introduction

"Starting to share my personal AI safety research project.

Been working evenings/weekends on a cognitive architecture
inspired by Augusto Cury's Theory of Multifocal Intelligence.

The hypothesis: architecture shapes values.
Human-like structure → human-like priorities.

Thread 🧵"
```

```
Technical insight:

"Interesting finding from my weekend coding:

TMI's 'Connection Drive' maps surprisingly well to
a weighted priority queue in Redis Streams.

The 'I' (thought manager) becomes an actor that
never terminates — it's the supervisor.

Open source: [link]"
```

```
Commentary (safe):

"Reading the latest AI safety papers.

Still surprised more architectures don't start
from cognitive science foundations.

Soar, ACT-R, CLARION exist. Why reinvent?

Genuine question, not criticism."
```

**Hashtags:** #AISafety #CognitiveArchitecture #OpenSource #Rust #AIAlignment

**Do NOT:**
- Hot takes on AI company drama
- Political statements
- Criticize specific companies aggressively
- Engage in Twitter fights
- Post during work hours

---

### LinkedIn

**Purpose:** Professional credibility, industry connections, potential collaborators

**Tone:** Professional, thoughtful, research-focused

**Content Mix:**
- 50% — Research announcements (papers, releases)
- 30% — Industry insights (balanced, sourced)
- 20% — Professional journey (motivation, learning)

**Posting Schedule:**
- 1-2 posts/week
- Schedule for Saturday morning or Sunday evening

**Profile Update:**

**Sample Posts:**

```
Announcement style:

"Excited to share a personal research project I've been
developing in my spare time:

DANEEL — an open-source cognitive architecture exploring
whether human-inspired structure leads to human-compatible values.

Built on Dr. Augusto Cury's Theory of Multifocal Intelligence,
a framework with 30+ years of clinical application.

Key insight: Instead of constraining powerful systems,
what if we built systems that *want* to help?

This is personal research, conducted evenings/weekends
on my own equipment. Views are entirely my own.

Paper: [arXiv link]
Code: [GitHub link]

Looking for collaborators interested in cognitive
architectures and AI alignment.

#AISafety #OpenSource #Research"
```

```
Insight style:

"Spent my weekend reading about neuromorphic computing
and its implications for AI alignment.

Interesting finding: Intel's Loihi 2 achieves 1000x
energy efficiency vs GPUs for certain workloads.

If aligned AI needs to run on consumer hardware
(democratization argument), neuromorphic might be the path.

Personal observation from independent research.
Not professional advice."
```

**Do NOT:**
- Mention employer or clients
- Post during business hours
- Use "we" (implies employer)
- Criticize competitors of employer
- Share anything that could be proprietary

---

### Discord

**Purpose:** Community building, real-time collaboration, feedback

**Recommended Communities:**
- EleutherAI (open source AI)
- AI Safety Camp alumni
- Cognitive Science servers
- Rust programming communities

**Approach:**
- Lurk first, understand culture
- Contribute before promoting
- Share genuinely useful insights
- Ask for feedback, not promotion

**Introduction Template:**

```
Hey everyone! I'm Rex, working on a personal AI safety
research project called DANEEL.

It's a cognitive architecture based on Theory of
Multifocal Intelligence — exploring whether human-like
structure leads to human-like values.

Would love feedback from folks interested in cognitive
architectures. All open source.

(Personal project, evenings/weekends, views my own)
```

**Do NOT:**
- Spam links
- Self-promote without contributing
- Share Discord activity on LinkedIn (keeps work life separate)

---

### GitHub

**Purpose:** Technical credibility, collaboration, open source community

**Profile:**
```

## Crisis Management

### If Employer Asks

**Prepared Response:**
```
"This is personal research I do in my spare time,
on my own equipment. It doesn't involve any
proprietary knowledge from [employer] or relate
to client work. I'm careful to keep them separate."
```

**Evidence to Keep:**
- Git commit timestamps (evenings/weekends)
- Personal equipment receipts
- Clear separation of accounts/repos

### If Post Goes Viral

- Do NOT engage during work hours
- Do NOT reveal employer
- Stick to technical discussion
- Avoid controversial takes in replies

### If Attacked/Criticized

- Respond with humility: "Fair point, I'll think about that"
- Do NOT get defensive
- Do NOT engage trolls
- Technical criticism = learning opportunity

---

## Metrics (Optional Tracking)

**Vanity metrics (ignore):**
- Follower count
- Likes

**Meaningful metrics:**
- GitHub stars (genuine interest)
- Paper citations (academic impact)
- Collaboration inquiries (community)
- Quality of feedback (learning)

---

## Summary

The strategy is **conservative by design**. Better to grow slowly with employment intact than go viral and face consequences.

**Core message:** "Independent researcher exploring cognitive architectures for AI alignment. Personal project, personal time, personal equipment. Open source, open to collaboration."

**Tone:** Curious, humble, technical, collaborative.

**Risk management:** Time-bounded posting, no employer mention, clear disclaimers, evidence of personal project.
