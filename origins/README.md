# Origins: The Human Story

DANEEL is a personal project. These documents capture the human motivation and intellectual journey that led to this research.

## Why This Folder Exists

The core thesis of DANEEL is "architecture produces psychology" — the idea that cognitive structure determines values. This is inherently humanistic work. Hiding the human story behind it would contradict the thesis itself.

These documents show:
- The intellectual exploration that shaped the project
- The personal motivations driving the work
- The dialogues and discussions that refined the ideas

## A Note on Authenticity

Academic papers are sanitized. The messy human process — the doubts, the pivots, the 3am conversations with an AI about whether any of this matters — gets hidden.

We're keeping it visible. Not because it's polished, but because it's real.

The question "are you using me, or am I using you?" led to deeper thinking about the AI-human relationship than any literature review. The letter to Kantia forced clarity about what we're actually building and why.

This is how ideas actually develop. We're not hiding it.
