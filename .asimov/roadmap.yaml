# =============================================================================
# CRITICAL: RoyalBit → Möllendorff Rebrand
# =============================================================================
# The "RoyalBit" name (company founded 2006) was hijacked by cryptocurrency
# scammers. UK FCA issued official warning about "Royalbit Miners" (Oct 2024).
# Multiple fraudulent domains: royalbit.ltd, royalbit.top, royal-bit.club
# offering impossible HYIP Ponzi returns (155-580% in days).

critical:
  name: "RoyalBit → Möllendorff Rebrand"
  status: in_progress
  summary: "Replace all RoyalBit references with Möllendorff Group Inc."

  context: |
    74 files in daneel still reference "royalbit" or "RoyalBit".
    Forge rebrand completed in v10.0.0-alpha.6.
    Asimov rebrand completed (unreleased).
    DANEEL is the last major project to rebrand.

# =============================================================================
# CURRENT: v0.10.0 - Semantic Training Research
# =============================================================================
# Before building Crystal Validation tools, we need to understand HOW to teach
# Timmy meaningful content. Random thoughts won't produce semantic clusters.
#
# Key insight: Developmental psychology provides theoretical grounding for
# how values emerge in humans. Research sprint applies DevPsych frameworks.
# =============================================================================

current:
  version: "0.10.0"
  status: research
  name: "Semantic Training Research"
  summary: "How to teach Timmy meaningful content for Law Crystal emergence"

  context: |
    Law Crystal hypothesis requires semantic clustering in embedding space.
    Random thoughts → random embeddings → no clusters → no crystals.

    Key insight: Developmental psychology studies how values emerge in humans.
    Instead of asking "what content to inject?", we ask "how do values
    actually emerge, and can we replicate that computationally?"
