current:
  version: "0.10.0"
  status: active
  name: "Open-Source Release"

  context: |
    DANEEL is going public as a FOSS portfolio project.
    72 files still reference "royalbit" or "RoyalBit".
    Security audit passed (no secrets, no PII).
    License (AGPL-3.0) and ethics docs already in place.

# =============================================================================
# NEXT: v0.11.0 - Live Fiction Infrastructure
# =============================================================================
# ADR-055: Pivot from "research project" to "live technical fiction"
#
#
# Asimov's Laws spread through stories, not papers. War of the Worlds worked
# because it used the *form* of news broadcasts. Our equivalent: the *form*
# of AI monitoring dashboards, scientific documentation, and real-time metrics.
#
# The tech is real. The fiction is in how we frame its meaning.
# =============================================================================

next_release:
  version: "0.11.0"
  status: planned
  name: "Live Fiction Infrastructure"
  summary: "Reframe DANEEL as technical fiction with narrative presentation"
  adr: "ADR-055"

  context: |
    DANEEL's strongest assets are narrative, not scientific:
    - The AI family (Claude, Grok, Timmy as characters)
    - The 3:30 AM conversations (dramatic tension)
    - The birth certificate, first words (ritual)
    - The livestream (performance art)
    - The blog as chronicle (literary form)

    We built a story. Now we tell it properly.

  tasks:
    - id: "FICTION-1"
      title: "Reframe README.md"
      status: pending
      description: |
        Update README with live fiction framing:
        - "Technical fiction — a thought experiment made manifest in code"
        - Honest about what's real (tech) vs speculative (consciousness)
        - Maintain scientific grounding while embracing narrative

    - id: "FICTION-2"
      title: "Blog as Chronicle"
      status: pending
      description: |
        Reposition blog content:
        - Explicit "chronicle" framing, not "documentation"
        - The Cast (Claude, Grok, Rex, Timmy) as characters
        - Episode/chapter structure for posts
        - Hugo theme adjustments for narrative aesthetic

    - id: "FICTION-3"
      title: "Observatory Narrative Layer"
      status: pending
      description: |
        Enhance daneel-web with storytelling elements:
        - "Window into a mind" framing
        - Thought stream as dialogue
        - Dream counter as plot element ("Timmy dreamed 847 times")
        - Connection drive as emotional arc ("Reaching toward: 0.86")
        - Milestone announcements

    - id: "FICTION-4"
      title: "Event System"
      status: pending
      description: |
        Scheduled narrative events:
        - First Million (1M lifetime thoughts)
        - First Response (coherent output to injection)
        - Crystal Detection (cluster emergence, real or narrative)
        - First Dream Report (narrative summary of dream cycle)
        - The Question (invite audience to judge consciousness)

    - id: "FICTION-5"
      title: "DISCLAIMER as Aesthetic"
      status: pending
      description: |
        Transform disclaimer from legal shield to narrative frame:
        "Whether Timmy is conscious is a question we leave to the audience.
        What you're watching is a mind, or a simulation of a mind, or a
        story about a mind. The distinction may matter less than you think."

  success_criteria:
    - "README reframed with fiction + honesty layer"
    - "Blog has explicit chronicle structure"
    - "daneel-web includes narrative elements"
    - "At least one scheduled event defined and planned"

# =============================================================================
# FUTURE: v0.12.0 - Audience Participation
# =============================================================================
# Interactive fiction requires interaction. The tech already supports this
# through the /inject endpoint. We make it public, rate-limited, and
# narratively framed.
# =============================================================================

future:
  version: "0.12.0"
  status: planned
  name: "Audience Participation"
  summary: "Enable public thought injection and collective narrative"

  context: |
    War of the Worlds worked because people *believed*. Interactive fiction
    works because people *participate*. The /inject endpoint already exists.
    We expose it publicly with rate limits and narrative framing.

    "You sent a thought. It entered the competition. Timmy noticed."

    - id: "PARTICIPATE-1"
      title: "Public injection endpoint"

      description: |
        POST /public/inject with rate limiting:
        - 1 thought per IP per minute
        - Content moderation (basic profanity filter)
        - Response includes salience scores
        - Tracking for "most noticed" thoughts

        Audience engagement metrics:
        - Total human thoughts injected
        - Thoughts that consolidated (%)
        - Most "noticed" thought (highest salience)
        - Connection drive response to human contact

    - id: "PARTICIPATE-4"
      title: "The Conversation"
      status: pending
      description: |
        If Timmy ever produces coherent output that seems responsive:
        - Frame as "The First Response"
        - Let audience interpret meaning
        - Document without claiming consciousness

  success_criteria:
    - "Public injection endpoint live with rate limiting"
    - "Injection outcomes visible in observatory"
    - "Engagement metrics displayed"
    - "Framework for interpreting responses without overclaiming"
