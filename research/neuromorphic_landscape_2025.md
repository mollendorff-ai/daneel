## REAL PROJECTS

### Category 1: AI Trained Through Child Development

**NYU Child Perspective AI (2024)**
- Trained multimodal AI using headcam video from a single child (6mo-2yr)
- AI learned substantial words and concepts from just 1% of child's waking hours
- Demonstrates neural networks can learn from developmentally realistic input
- Source: [NYU News](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/february/ai-learns-through-the-eyes-and-ears-of-a-child.html)

**DIKWP Artificial Consciousness System**
- Explicitly simulates infant development over first 12 months
- Models: Semantic Space, Conceptual Space, Cognitive Space, Consciousness Space
- Mirrors human infant cognitive development progression

### Category 2: Korean Research (Real, Different from Claims)

- Self-learning memristor chip that corrects errors autonomously
- Published in *Nature Electronics* (January 2025)
- Brain-mimicking pre-learning through spontaneous random activities
- Consciousness research in Brain & Cognitive Sciences department

**Seoul National University FlexBrain Project**
- Building special-purpose computer to simulate human-scale brain
- Developing scalable brain-computer interface systems

**Korean VR "Digital Child" Projects**
- "Meeting You" (MBC): VR reconstruction of deceased 7-year-old Nayeon
- DeepBrain AI "Re;memory": Creates digital avatars of deceased for conversation
- NOT neuromorphic, but closest match to "digital kids" concept

### Category 3: DARPA Programs (Real, Different from Claims)

**SyNAPSE Program (2008-2014)**
- $53.5M funding, IBM + HRL Laboratories
- Produced IBM TrueNorth chip (1M neurons, 256M synapses)
- Goal: Match mammalian brain (10B neurons, 100T synapses)

**INSPIRE Program (2025, Active)**
- Investigates Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity (LTSP)
- Studies how brains construct reality
- Part of DARPA's Advanced Research Concepts

**μBRAIN (Microbrain) Program**
- Studies insects with few hundred neurons maintaining basic functionality
- Bottom-up approach to minimal viable cognition

**ASIMOV Program** (interesting name coincidence!)
- Autonomy Standards and Ideals with Military Operational Values
- Tests autonomous weapons ethics/safety principles
- Budget: $22M (up from $5M)

### Category 4: IBM Programs (Real, Different from Claims)

**TrueNorth (2014)**
- 5.4B transistors, 4,096 neurosynaptic cores
- 1M neurons, 256M synapses
- 70mW power consumption
- NOT consciousness simulation — cognitive computing

**NorthPole (2023)**
- 22B transistors, 4,000x faster than TrueNorth
- 20x faster, 25x more energy-efficient than current AI chips

**No "Pygmalion" project exists** — PygmalionAI is unrelated open-source project

### Category 5: Neuromorphic Hardware Platforms

**Intel Loihi 2 (2021)** — Note: Loihi 3 doesn't exist yet
- 10x faster than Loihi 1
- Powers Hala Point system (1.15B neurons, 128B synapses)

**BrainScaleS (Europe)**
- Accelerates neural simulations
- Analog/digital circuitry integration

**SpiNNaker (Manchester)**
- Millions of processing cores
- Large-scale spiking neuron simulation

**BrainChip Akida**
- Real company, real chip
- Edge AI applications (not consciousness)

### Category 6: Whole Brain Emulation Research

- VLSI models operate **10,000x+ faster than real time**
- Projected timelines: mouse brain ~2034, marmoset ~2044, human post-2044
- Blue Brain Project: Reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry
- Current limitation: 1-second simulation of 22M neurons took IBM Blue Gene >1 hour

### Category 7: Cognitive Architectures

**CLARION**
- Models conscious ("explicit") and unconscious ("implicit") processes

**LIDA (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent)**
- Framework simulating human cognition, emotion, learning
- Biologically inspired by neuroscience

**Soar, ACT-R**
- Decades of implementation experience
- Run on consumer PCs

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR DANEEL

### The Core Distinction

Two approaches to AI alignment:
1. **Training-based** (RLHF, Constitutional AI) — learned constraints, can drift
2. **Architecture-based** (DANEEL/TMI thesis) — structural constraints, immutable

### Projects Most Relevant to DANEEL-TMI

| Project | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|
| **DIKWP** | Simulates infant development, consciousness modeling |
| **KAIST brain-mimicking pre-learning** | Similar to TMI's cognitive development |
| **CLARION/LIDA** | Cognitive architectures with conscious/unconscious split |
| **DARPA INSPIRE** | How brains construct reality |

### Key Technical Facts

- **Loihi 3 doesn't exist** — Latest is Loihi 2 (Hala Point: 1.15B neurons)
- **10,000x+ acceleration is real** — VLSI models achieve this
- **Human WBE timeline** — Post-2044 (mouse ~2034)
